# Wiki

This is the default starting page of the wiki. You can edit it or create a new page.
To link to a new or existing page, simply use the link syntax in Markdown, like:

```markdown
    This is a [link](relative-path-to-another-file) to another page.
```

Which, in preview-mode, would look like:

>    This is a [link](relative-path-to-another-file) to another page.

If the link URL is omitted in the parentheses (`()`) then it defaults to the display name
specified in the square brackets (`[...]`).

Clicking on a link navigates to the page (view) if it exists. If the page doesn't already exists,
it gets created and the app lets you edit it right then.

When editing a page, you may click the `Preview` button anytime to see how it will be rendered;
clicking the `Save` button to save the page and return to the page view mode.

Clicking on a link with an external URL will open the page in a separate window.

You can drag and drop files or directories in the file explorer panel on the left to
organize your pages. Right clicking on the panel opens a context menu that allows you
to delete and rename selected files.
